UI TESTING : 

UI testing is bascially a can be used to test the functionalities of the different application .
UI testing is about checking two things: how your application handles user actions performed via mouse, keyboard, and other input devices.
whether the visual elements (buttons, links, text fields, images, and so on) are displayed correctly and work as intended.

 There are two ways to test the applications

-> Manually 
-> Automatically


Summary:

In Automated Ui , the code will automatically make the browser or application to perform different action and steps to observe or test the functionalities.
In this Assignment We auomate Ui of the different functionalities of  metabase using pycharm selnium (python langauge).
So , we follow the following steps to run our automated ui test case.


STEps : 

In this Assignment we done the Automated UI testing of application(metabase) by using Python (selenium)in Pycharm(IDE) integrated develpoment environemnt.

Firstly we need to do setup of a metabase by downloading it .We need java for its installation and runiing . Then we make environment variable paths then we install pip selenium and behave.

After that we need a pycharm ide that required python for it .Install latest version of python then ide .Then make the project in Ide (Pycharm) .

After that make a directory of step in the project then make a python file with extenion .py after that write a code in it

So , we can done automatically so we just need to wrtie the python file  that firstly  will load the driver of the browser we did our in  a chrome for our automation 

then open the link of a metabase (localhost:3000) which will open the metabase in the broswer . 

Then we will provide the username and password by sendkey to the metabase through coding (by detching xpath or by fetching through class or id)

Then It opens the metabase ,After that we wrote different code to test different functionalitiies .As we wrote a code to open a setting our code will open it by self by calling code

.click is used when use to click


Conculsion : 

 (UI)User interface testing is important because it helps ensure that your app or website is easy to use and navigate for your users.
By testing the UI, you can catch any potential issues that might make using your app or website difficult or confusing for your users.
UI testing is the process of verifying that an appâ€™s UI not only behaves as intended but also empowers users to make the most out of it with the least effort.
